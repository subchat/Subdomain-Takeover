    <h2>Subdomain Enumeration</h2>
    <p>Subdomain enumeration is the process of discovering subdomains associated with a domain. This is often performed for various reasons including security assessment, vulnerability research, and reconnaissance. Tools such as Sublist3r, Knock, and DNSDumpster are commonly used for subdomain enumeration.</p>

    <h2>Subdomain Takeover Experience</h2>
    <p>I have successfully identified a subdomain takeover vulnerability on a Shopify site during my security assessments. This involved finding a subdomain that pointed to a resource (e.g., a CNAME record) controlled by the attacker. By taking over this resource, the attacker could potentially control the subdomain's functionality, leading to various security risks.</p>
